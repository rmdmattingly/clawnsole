# Clawnsole itself is plain HTTP.
# This Caddyfile terminates TLS and proxies to the active Clawnsole port.

# HTTPS (local/internal cert). To trust the local CA on macOS:
#   sudo /opt/homebrew/bin/caddy trust
https://clawnsole.local {
  tls internal
  reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:__PORT__
}

# Redirect HTTP -> HTTPS
http://clawnsole.local {
  redir https://{host}{uri} permanent
}
